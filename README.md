#Supply Chain Management System

##Overview
This project is a basic Supply Chain Management System implemented in Java. The system allows the user to interact with a warehouse to view available products, create an order by adding products, and then calculate the total price of the order. It simulates the process of managing inventory and processing orders in a supply chain environment.

##Features
1.Warehouse Management: The system stores a list of products available in the warehouse. Each product has a name and a price.
2.Order Creation: Users can create an order by selecting products from the warehouse and adding them to their cart.
3.Order Viewing: Users can view the products in their order and see the total price of their current order.
4.Checkout: Once the order is complete, users can checkout to finish the transaction.
